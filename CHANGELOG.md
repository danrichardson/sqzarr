# Changelog

## 2026-04-09

### New features
- **Space saved detail page** — dashboard stat is now clickable, links to `/savings` with per-file breakdown showing original size, new size, savings, and percentage (TKT-001)
- **Interactive dashboard stats** — Jobs Done and Failed cards link to filtered history views; History page has status filter pills (TKT-002)
- **Bitrate skip margin** — scanner skips files already within a configurable margin of the target bitrate, avoiding unnecessary re-encodes. Default 10% (TKT-003)
- **Directory presets** — copy settings from an existing directory to pre-fill the add form; batch-add multiple directories at once via a single API call (TKT-005)
- **Encoder selection** — Settings page shows all detected hardware encoders + software fallback; select and switch encoders at runtime without restarting (TKT-008)
- **Password management UI** — set, change, or remove password from the Settings page instead of CLI-only `sqzarr hash-password` (TKT-009)

### Bug fixes
- **Files no longer reappear in queue after processing or exclusion** — introduced durable `processed_files` table that tracks processed/excluded files independently of job history. Clearing history no longer re-queues files on the next scan (TKT-004)
- **Clear history now includes completed jobs** — `done` and `staged` jobs are cleared alongside failed/cancelled, with processed_files preserving re-queue prevention (TKT-006)
- **Permission denied errors correctly classified** — I/O errors (permission denied, disk full, network errors) now show as red "Error" badges instead of being silently marked "Excluded" (TKT-007)
- **Config file writer no longer corrupts bcrypt hashes** — `$` characters in TOML values were being interpreted as regex backreferences; fixed with literal string replacement
- **Login page handles password-less mode** — redirects to dashboard when no password is configured instead of showing a dead-end login form
