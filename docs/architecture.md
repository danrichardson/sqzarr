# SQZARR Architecture (Current)

This document is the concise, current architecture reference for the running system.

## Runtime shape

- Single Go binary (sqzarr) serves API + embedded frontend.
- SQLite database in data_dir.
- ffmpeg/ffprobe are external runtime dependencies.
- Primary deployment target is Linux (systemd), with macOS launchd support.

## Core components

- API server: HTTP routes under /api/v1 and static frontend assets.
- Scanner: periodic directory scan; applies per-directory rules.
- Queue worker: executes transcode jobs, updates progress/state.
- Transcoder: hardware probe + ffmpeg invocation with software fallback.
- Verifier: confirms output validity before replacing source.
- Originals workflow: processed originals moved to per-root processed dir, with retention/restore controls.
- Integrations: optional Plex refresh after successful replacement.

## Data and state

- DB: SQLite (sqzarr.db) with migrations applied on startup.
- Primary entities:
  - directories (scan roots + rules)
  - jobs (queue + history)
  - originals (held originals for review/retention)
  - scan_runs (scan audit)
  - stats (aggregates)
- Config file: sqzarr.toml (TOML), editable via Settings API and UI.

## Request/processing flow

1. Scanner walks configured directories.
2. Candidate files are evaluated by age, size, bitrate, and margin rules.
3. Eligible files are enqueued as jobs.
4. Worker starts ffmpeg transcode with selected encoder.
5. Output is verified for integrity and savings criteria.
6. Original handling:
   - keep transcoded output
   - move original to processed_dir_name
   - retain for originals_retention_days
7. Job and aggregate stats are updated; optional Plex refresh is triggered.

## API surface (high level)

- Status/stats: service health, encoder, queue summary.
- Jobs: list/filter, enqueue, cancel, retry, clear terminal history.
- Directories: CRUD, batch create, browse filesystem, enqueue by directory.
- Originals review: list, delete (accept), restore, restore+exclude.
- Settings: read/update runtime configuration.
- Auth: optional password-based admin auth.

## Frontend

- React + TypeScript app embedded in backend binary.
- Main pages:
  - Dashboard
  - Queue
  - History
  - Directories
  - Review
  - Settings

## Safety and operational guarantees

- No Docker runtime dependency.
- Per-job temp-space checks prevent unsafe transcodes.
- Output verification before source replacement.
- Restore path for held originals.
- Path validation/allowlisting for filesystem-facing API calls.

## Script entry points (repo root)

- build_linux.sh: local Linux target build.
- deploy.sh: frontend build + source sync + remote rebuild/restart.
- build_now.sh: convenience wrapper for deploy.
- deploy.sh.example: template for machine-local wrapper.
